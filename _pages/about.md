I am a **GIS and Remote Sensing specialist** with over 15 years of experience in Enterprise GIS deployment, spatial data science, and environmental engineering. Currently, I serve as a **Senior Spatial Systems Officer** for the Queensland Government.

I hold a **Ph.D. from the University of Newcastle**, where I utilized Machine Learning and Google Earth Engine to analyze the environmental impacts of urban growth. My career bridges the gap between high-level industrial engineering (having worked with **Chevron** and **Woolpert**) and advanced academic research.

### Core Expertise
* **Enterprise GIS:** ArcGIS Enterprise (Portal, Server), VertiGIS, and Cloud GIS (AWS/GCP).
* **Spatial Data Science:** Expert in Python, R, and JavaScript for remote sensing.
* **Environmental Engineering:** ESHIA, EIA, and sustainable resource management.
